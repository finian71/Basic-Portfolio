                I enjoy riding motorcycles. I have been riding for about 10 years now. I own several motorcycles now and each has its own charm when it comes to the style of riding. I love that motorcycles can make for a great tool for transportation but also a way to enjoy life. I personally choose to work on my bikes on my own if I can help it. There is a lot of pride when I'm able to get my hands dirty and end up with the results I want in the end.

                I am also a huge fan of technology. I have been working with technology since I was about thirteen years old. The first computer I ever had had a lot of issues; this gave me an opportunity to learn to resolve them.

                Lately I have acquired a passion for hiking and camping. It's not something I ever did growing up. As odd as that may be since I was living in Utah. It's definitely something I had always been interested in and as of late I have been exploring my love for nature. It's always an adventure and never goes as expected.
